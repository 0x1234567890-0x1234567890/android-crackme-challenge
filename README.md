### What is This? ###
This project is a collection of Android CrackMe challenges that students can use to learn about the art of reverse engineering mobile software. I do not claim to be an expert at this, but I've learned enough to build some exciting challenges for the community. Your goal is simple, build and run each APK/challenge, complete all the challenges for knowledge and profit. If you get stuck, read the hint, if you get really stuck, read the source. Each challenge will have some way to verify that you've completed it.

### Getting the Challenges ###
The apks will be on my blog soon, and the links will be posted here.

### Mobile Android Challenges ###

* Challenge One   : A file will be created within the application's sandbox boundaries. You must extract its contents.
* Challenge Two   : Builds on challenge one, data gets dumped to Logcat, and may need search engine foo.
* Challenge Three : This app searches a webpage for a string. Go on your own network and insert the string with a man-in-the-middle attack. :]
* Chellenge Four  : The app unlocks only when you're in Minnesota. Either travel to Minnesota or learn about mock locations to complete the challenge.
* Challenge Five  : The password is stored in the app's string resources. Decompile the app and go get it. This should be fairly easy.
* Challenge Six   : PENDING

### Setting Up Your Dev Machine ###

* Summary
This software was written using Android Studio. You'll probably want to download the installation package from Google and build one of the test apps before attempting to build this one.

* Android Developer Studio: https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html

Other tools you can use to break these apps:

* Mitmproxy: http://mitmproxy.org/
* Kali Linux (Includes mitmproxy): https://www.kali.org/downloads/
* VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
