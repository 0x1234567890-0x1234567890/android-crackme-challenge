### What is This? ###
This project is a collection of CTF style Android challenges that student at the Rochester Insititute of Technology can use to learn about the art of reverse engineering mobile software. I do not claim to be an expert at this, but I've learned enough to build some exciting challenges. Your goal is simple, build and run each APK/challenge, complete all the challenges for knowledge/profit. If you get stuck, read the source, or if you aren't cheating, read the hint. Each challenge will have some way to verify that you've completed it i.e. enter unique string in box and hit the button.

### Mobile Android Challenges ###

* Challenge One : A file will be created within the application's sandbox boundaries. You must extract its contents. [EASYMODE]

### Setting Up Your Dev Machine ###

* Summary
In short, you gotta install Android Studio. This software was written using Android Studio version 0.8.1. You'll probably want to download the installation package from Google and build one of the test apps before attempting to build this one.

* Configuration
SDK Target is 4.3 with support back to API 11 (3.0)
